# Calendar Plugin

Two-mode calendar system for campaigns. **Fantasy mode**: arbitrary months, weekdays,
moons (with phase calculations), seasons (with wrap-around date ranges), leap years,
configurable time systems. **Real-life mode**: Gregorian calendar synced to wall clock,
user timezone-aware. Both modes support events (single-day, multi-day, recurring, with
optional start/end times). One calendar per campaign.

## Architecture

- **model.go**: Calendar, Month, Weekday, Moon, Season, Event structs + DTOs.
  `ModeFantasy`/`ModeRealLife` constants. `IsRealLife()` mode check.
  `MoonPhase()` / `MoonPhaseName()` for lunar cycle math.
  `IsLeapYear()`, `YearLengthForYear()`, `MonthDays()` for date arithmetic.
  `ContainsDate()` on Season with wrap-around support.
  `FormatCurrentTime()` on Calendar for HH:MM display.
  `HasTime()`, `FormatTime()`, `FormatEndTime()`, `FormatTimeRange()` on Event.
- **repository.go**: SQL CRUD for calendar + sub-resources. Set* methods replace
  all records (bulk update). Event listing with entity JOIN, visibility filtering,
  recurring event support. Events sort by date then time (COALESCE for null times).
- **service.go**: One-calendar-per-campaign enforcement, validation, date advancement
  with month/year rollover (leap-year-aware), time advancement with minute→hour→day
  rollover, CRUD orchestration.
- **handler.go**: HTTP handlers for monthly grid, timeline, settings, events, setup,
  advance date/time. HTMX detection for fragment vs full page. Mode-aware
  CreateCalendar seeds Gregorian months/weekdays for real-life mode.
- **routes.go**: Route registration with role middleware.
- **calendar.templ**: Monthly grid, timeline view, event modal (create/edit with
  optional time picker), upcoming events fragment, entity-events fragment, setup page
  with mode chooser (Real Life / Custom Fantasy / Import Coming Soon).
- **calendar_settings.templ**: 6-tab settings page (General, Months, Weekdays,
  Moons, Seasons, Eras) with Alpine.js list management. General tab includes time system
  configuration (hours/day, minutes/hour, seconds/minute) and current time. Seasons tab
  includes weather effect field per season. Eras tab manages named time periods with
  year ranges. Real-life mode hides Months/Weekdays/Eras tabs and date/time/leap-year
  fields.

## Data Model

- `calendars` — id, campaign_id, mode, name, description, epoch_name,
  current_year/month/day, hours_per_day, minutes_per_hour, seconds_per_minute,
  current_hour, current_minute, leap_year_every, leap_year_offset
- `calendar_months` — id, calendar_id, name, days, sort_order, is_intercalary,
  leap_year_days
- `calendar_weekdays` — id, calendar_id, name, sort_order
- `calendar_moons` — id, calendar_id, name, cycle_days, phase_offset, color
- `calendar_seasons` — id, calendar_id, name, start_month/day, end_month/day,
  description, color, weather_effect
- `calendar_eras` — id, calendar_id, name, start_year, end_year (nullable=ongoing),
  description, color, sort_order
- `calendar_events` — id, calendar_id, entity_id (FK), name, description,
  year/month/day, start_hour, start_minute, end_year/end_month/end_day, end_hour,
  end_minute, is_recurring, recurrence_type, visibility, category, created_by

## Time System

Calendars have a configurable time system with three parameters:
- **hours_per_day** (default 24) — How many hours in one day
- **minutes_per_hour** (default 60) — How many minutes in one hour
- **seconds_per_minute** (default 60) — How many seconds in one minute

Current time is tracked via `current_hour` and `current_minute`. The `AdvanceTime()`
service method handles rollover: minutes overflow into hours, hours overflow into
days (which then roll over months/years via the same logic as `AdvanceDate()`).

Events optionally have `start_hour/start_minute` and `end_hour/end_minute` (all
nullable). When set, times display on grid chips, timeline, and entity event lists.

## Calendar Modes

Two modes controlled by `calendars.mode`:

- **Fantasy** (`mode='fantasy'`, default): Full customization — arbitrary months,
  weekdays, time units, leap years. All settings tabs visible. Setup seeds generic
  12×30-day months and 7 weekdays.
- **Real-Life** (`mode='reallife'`): Gregorian calendar synced to wall clock.
  Setup seeds correct Gregorian months (Jan 31, Feb 28 +1 leap, etc.), weekdays
  (Sunday–Saturday), 24/60/60 time, leap year every 4. Settings page hides Months,
  Weekdays tabs and date/time/time-system/leap-year fields (Gregorian is fixed).
  Current date/time derived from `time.Now()` + user's IANA timezone.

User timezone stored in `users.timezone` (nullable, default UTC). Managed via
`GET /account` settings page.

## Key Design Decisions

- **One calendar per campaign** (unlike maps' many-per-campaign). Enforced in
  service CreateCalendar().
- **Bulk sub-resource updates**: SetMonths/SetWeekdays/SetMoons/SetSeasons/SetEras
  replace all records rather than individual CRUD — simpler client-side serialization.
- **Percentage-free date system**: Month days and leap year days are integers.
  Year length calculated by summing month days + per-month leap extras.
- **Moon phases**: Continuous 0.0–1.0 value from `cycle_days` and `phase_offset`.
  Mapped to 8 named phases (New, Waxing Crescent, etc.).
- **Season wrap-around**: `ContainsDate()` handles seasons crossing year boundary
  (e.g., Winter from month 11 to month 2).
- **Event categories**: holiday, battle, quest, birthday, festival, travel, custom.
  Each has an icon in the UI.
- **Dual views**: Monthly grid (default) and timeline (chronological, year-grouped).

## Sync API Integration

Calendar has full REST API endpoints exposed through the sync-api plugin for external
tools (Foundry VTT). See `internal/plugins/syncapi/` for those routes.

## Dashboard Integration

- `calendar_preview` block type for campaign dashboard editor
- `GET /calendar/upcoming?limit=N` serves HTMX fragment with current date, season,
  and upcoming events
- Entity-event reverse lookup: `GET /calendar/entity-events/:eid` serves events
  linked to a specific entity (lazy-loaded on entity profile pages)
